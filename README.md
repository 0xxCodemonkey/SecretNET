# Secret.NET Core Library
Secret.NET (port of the [secret.js](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js) Client) is an .NET SDK for writing applications that interact with the [Secret Network blockchain](https://scrt.network/).

# Key Features
- Written in .NET 6 including MAUI Support.
- Can be used in MAUI Apps on Android, iOS, Windows and Mac.
- Provides simple abstractions over core data structures.
- Supports every possible message and transaction type.
- Exposes every possible query type.
- Handles input/output encryption/decryption for Secret Contracts.
- The SDK has a wallet built in and does not currently require / support external wallets.
- Custom APIs / clients for specific smart contracts can be easily created (see packages for tokens / SNIP20 or NFT / SNIP721).

:information_source: This library is still in beta (as secret.js), APIs may break. Beta testers are welcome!
See [project board](https://github.com/users/0xxCodemonkey/projects/1/views/1) for list of existing/missing features.

## Additional packages
In addition to the Secret.NET Core Library, the following complementary packages are available:
- [**Full SNIP-20 (Token) client**](https://github.com/0xxCodemonkey/SecretNET.SNIP20), which exposes all methods of the [SNIP-20 reference implementation](https://github.com/scrtlabs/snip20-reference-impl).
- [**Full SNIP-721 / SNIP-722 (NFT) client**](https://github.com/0xxCodemonkey/SecretNET.SNIP721), which exposes all methods of the [SNIP-721 reference implementation](https://github.com/baedrik/snip721-reference-impl).
- **UI Package** (coming soon), which contains typical MAUI controls such as Confirm Transaction, Wallet Setup, Scan Keplr QR, etc.

# General information
The rough structure of the Secret.NET client, from the user's perspective, is divided into the following areas:
- **Queries** (accessible via ```Query``` property), to get informations from the blockchain or an smart contract.
- **Transactions** (accessible via ```Tx``` property), to interact activly with the blockchain e.g. sending funds or calling smart contract methods.
- **Permits** (accessible via ```Permit``` property) for requesting protected informations in a query, without the need for a separate transaction.

**Queries** cost no fees, are executed "immediately" and do not require a wallet.

**Transactions** are broadcast to the blockchain in encrypted form and have to be processed. Therefore, they cost fees and the messages must be signed by the sender and a wallet is required for signing the transactions.

All transactions can also be simulated via ``Tx.Simulate`` to determine the estimated fees.

**Permits** can be signed with the ```Permit.Sign``` method.

**All types and methods are documented and eases programming:**

# Usage 
## Installation
The Secret.NET Core Libray can be easily installed via Nuget: 

``` nuget.exe ``` -CLI:
``` bash 
nuget install SecretNET
```
[NuGet-Paket-Manager-Konsole](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell):
```  bash
Install-Package SecretNET
```

## Additional packages
nuget.exe-CLI:
```  bash
nuget install SecretNET.SNIP20
nuget install SecretNET.SNIP721
nuget install SecretNET.UI (coming soon)
```

NuGet-Paket-Manager-Konsole:
```  bash
Install-Package SecretNET.SNIP20
Install-Package SecretNET.SNIP721
Install-Package SecretNET.UI (coming soon)
```
# Examples
## Creating / Initializing the wallet
The wallet will use per default an secure storage which protects the sensitive data in a platform-specific manner:

| Plattform | Info |
| ------------- | -------------  |
| Android | Data is encrypted with the Android EncryptedSharedPreference Class, and the secure storage value is encrypted with AES-256 GCM. |
| iOS / macOS | The iOS Keychain is used to store values securely. | 
| Windows | DataProtectionProvider is used to encrypt values securely on Windows devices. | 

:warning: **Never store the private key or mnemonic phrase permanent in a variable (or somewhere else than in a secure storage) or output them in a log!**
**Only store them in a secure storage like the default implementation.**

### Importing account from mnemonic phrase
Simply use the mnemonic phrase in the ```Wallet.Create``` method (and use the wallet in the constructor of the SecretNetworkClient:) like this

```  csharp
var walletFromMnemonic = await SecretNET.Wallet.Create("detect unique diary skate horse hockey gain naive approve rabbit act lift");
```
### Importing private key
Simply use the private key in the ```Wallet.Create``` method (and use the wallet in the constructor of the SecretNetworkClient:) like this
```  csharp
var walletFromSeed = await SecretNET.Wallet.Create(** byte[] private key **);
```
### Import via Keplr QR
- coming soon...
### Generating a new account
To generate a complete new random wallet just use the ```Wallet.Create``` method without a parameter (default wordlist is english), or specify another Wordlist (also supported: chinese_simplified, chinese_traditional, japanese, spanish, french, portuguese_brazil and czech).
```  csharp
var newRandomWallet = await SecretNET.Wallet.Create(Wordlist.English);
```
### Attaching the wallet to the SecretNetworkClient (required for signing transactions)
In the constructor:
```  csharp
var secretNetworkClient = new SecretNetworkClient("https://pulsar-2.api.trivium.network:9091", "pulsar-2", wallet);
```
Later via prop:
```  csharp
secretNetworkClient.Wallet = walletFromMnemonic;
```
## Sending Queries
## Broadcasting Transactions
## Uploading and initialize Smart Contract
## Calling a Smart Contract
## Interacting with an Token Contract (SNIP20)
## Interacting with an NFT Contract (SNIP721)
# SecretNetworkClient
**Full API Â»**

## Querier
The querier can only send queries and get chain information. Access to all query types can be done via ```SecretNetworkClient.Query```.

## Transactions
Use ```SecretNetworkClient.Tx``` to broadcast transactions.
