# Secret.NET Core Library
Secret.NET (port of the [secret.js](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js) Client) is an .NET SDK for writing applications that interact with the [Secret Network blockchain](https://scrt.network/).

# Key Features
- Written in .NET 6 including MAUI Support.
- Can be used in MAUI Apps on Android, iOS, Windows and Mac.
- Provides simple abstractions over core data structures.
- Supports every possible message and transaction type.
- Exposes every possible query type.
- Handles input/output encryption/decryption for Secret Contracts.
- The SDK has a wallet built in and does not currently require / support external wallets.
- Custom APIs / clients for specific smart contracts can be easily created (see packages for tokens / SNIP20 or NFT / SNIP721).

:information_source: This library is still in beta (as [secret.js](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js)), APIs may break. Beta testers are welcome!
